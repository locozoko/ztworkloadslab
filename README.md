# **Prerequisites**
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Git

- Clone this repo to obtain all the required CloudFormation Templates. 
- You can also manually download this repo by clicking the green "Repo" button > Download ZIP.

## AWS Account

- An AWS Account is required to deploy this lab. 
- The templates use the smallest instances sizes possible for minimal costs.

## AWS EC2 SSH Key

- All the templates that deploy EC2 instances require an existing AWS Key Pair to be selected. 
- Please create a Key Pair prior to starting this lab or use an exising Key Pair.
- This can be done in AWS > EC2 > Key Pairs > Create key pair
- [For help, see this AWS KB Article on Creating Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html)

## Cloud Connector

- You must be subscribed to Cloud Connector via the AWS Marketplace [Link Here to AWS Marketplace CC](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cvzx4oiv7oljm)
- All Cloud Connector prerequisites should be completed as normal. This is out of scope for the lab.
- The Cloud Connector tenant must have the ZPA-SERVER-PRE SKU enabled
- Cloud Connector API Key and Credentials must be stored in AWS Secrets Manager in the same Account and Region you plan to deploy the lab
- A Cloud Connector AWS Provisioning Template needs to exist. 
- [For help, see the Cloud Connector POV Tenant Prep Guide for SEs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17imm9_A6ByKAbDOeVGIAQQGW0rRxig5RLiXG0RAYc44/edit#heading=h.1kaphb5p9m0k)
- [For help, see this Cloud Connector AWS Prerequistes Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fvo151a_bcj-p8xX7y3FOeh2uKhXxf5SQJ9c7mzWNv8/edit)
